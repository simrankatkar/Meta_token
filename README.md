# ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course
This course was designed to introduce about some basic concepts about Web3 and Blockchain along with the solidity programming. There are various concepts of solidity i learnt from this course like as
1.Variables
2.Datatypes
3.Functions.,etc,
After Completion of all three given modules i have to make a contract token to work with the help of this concepts.

## Idea of the Challenge

I have to created contract name as MyToken where token name as  "lock" and token abbreviation as "key" along with the record of its total supply. If Anyone wants to mint some amount of OMT tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if someone burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply (Only if there is enough balance).

## Get Started
I wrote the code in Solidity Language, and I used Metacrafters ETH Proof as my source of learning.

### Process

* I used the Online Remix IDE for writing the solidity code Program with a version (pragma solidity 0.8.18) .
* Then I created a file which is in the repository named as ethtoken.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### Execution of Code 

* If you are using Remix IDE then you simply compile the code from the side menu.
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract from the side bar.
* And after deploying the code , you have to enter certain inputs according to requirement of smart contract. 

## Assist 

I would highly recommending to look at the Metacrafters academy for more such content. The members of community on their Discord server were so friendly and supportive, and I received a lot of assistance from them.
